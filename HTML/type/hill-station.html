                            former district has a popular town “Leh” and is a great tourist attraction because of its beautiful monasteries, picturesque locations, and interesting markets defining the culture of the place.

                        <h4>Kasol, Himachal Pradesh</h4>
                        <p>Kasol is a quaint little village in Himachal situated along the banks of the river Parvati. Commonly known as the 'Amsterdam of India', Kasol is a tourist attraction that is rapidly gaining fame as a popular hub for trekkers, backpackers,
                            and nature lovers. Kasol is situated 23 kms from Bhuntar and next to the religious town of Manikaran and is one of the best places in the country just to sit back and chill in the panorama of snow-clad mountains, pine trees
                            and gurgling river.</p>
                        <p>Kasol is famous for its trekking trails, which include treks to Kheerganga, Yanker Pass, Sar Pass, and Pin Parbati Pass. To get a real feel of the culture in this region, go on a visit to the village of Malana. Located a few kilometres
                            away from Kasol, Malana is a tiny hamlet inhabited by people living in self-imposed isolation. The people of Malana claim themselves to be Aryan descendants, as a result of which they avoid interaction with outsiders. The village
                            has plenty of scenic sights, though, and is often called ‘Little Greece’.
                        </p>
                        <p>Kasol is inhabited by a huge number of people from Israel, which is discernible from the plenteously available Israeli food, and the street signposts inscribed in Hebrew. Kasol has quite a few streetside cafes which serve delicious
                            food, and the experience of sitting and enjoying a meal amidst the dark green forests and the awe-inspiring mountains make the meal even more enjoyable.</p>
